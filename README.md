Software that enhances the excitement of listening to music by manipulating the images of real videos to match the beat of the music.

## Description

VeatBision is an open-source software that utilizes computer vision techniques to synchronize video elements with the beat of the music. By analyzing the music beat timing and tempo, VeatBision dynamically adjusts the size and color of video and music elements, creating a visually immersive experience.

## Main Functions

- Music beat timing analysis: VeatBision analyzes the beat timing of the music to identify the rhythm and tempo.
- Music tempo analysis: VeatBision determines the tempo of the music to synchronize the video elements accordingly.
- Music beat-based video element size change: VeatBision dynamically adjusts the size of video elements based on the music beat.
- Music beat-based music element color change: VeatBision changes the color of music elements based on the music beat.
- Music LUT filtering based on music genre: VeatBision applies Look-Up Table (LUT) filtering to the video based on the genre of the music.
- manually input beat timing to synchronize the video elements with the music beat.

## Planned Features

- PTAM-based insertion of elements that match the lyrics.
- PTAM-based insertion of lyrics into the music video.
